# Quantum Portfolio Optimization With Time Series Forecasting for Stock Market Investing 

This project aims to explore the application of quantum computing in the field of finance, particularly in stock market investing. The project combines classical and quantum optimization methods with LSTM time series forecasting to improve the performance of portfolio optimization. By incorporating predicted future stock returns into the optimization process, the project seeks to enhance the decision-making process for asset allocation and potentially achieve better returns and reduced risk.
